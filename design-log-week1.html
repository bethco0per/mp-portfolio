<h2>Week 1</h2>

<p><strong>Monday 11<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>

<p>Web Design &ndash; We were introduced to the design and development of a website. We had a selection of website templates to choose from as&nbsp; a base for us to work on, I chose Grayscale. As well as this, we set up accounts for atom, and GitHub, and learnt a bit more about the platforms and their purpose.</p>
<p>Photography &ndash; For our first session of photography we were in the media lab, and looked at the cameras (Fujifilm X-T3) to understand how they work and to get a feel for the new equipment. We also went through the basics of the lens, the recording medium and the storage system, in order to understand the camera which we then applied when taking pictures around the university.</p>
<p>Both of these sessions were crucial towards my final portfolio, as having no real experience in Web Design or Photography, the basics are very important, as it helped me to get a feel for both the equipment and the tools needed in order to make a successful and working website. Without the basic knowledge, you cant move forward, you need this to move forward. Understanding the camera is also important for my final video, as well as photography.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Tuesday 12<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>

<p>Web Design &ndash; We explored how to use Atom and GitHub further. For example, we were shown how atom is used as the code of the website, this is where you make any changes to your site, then GitHub is used to finalise any changes you have made and push your website up to a public format rather than private.</p>
<p>Web Design - This is important in the process of my final portfolio, because Atom and GitHub is the base of web design, it is crucial to understand these fully in order to make any sort of process with the website. The code is complex but is the core of the making of a website, therefore understanding it helps the process feel a lot easier and much less confusing.</p>
<p>Photography - We continued to work with the camera and looked at the different settings to help improve our photography skills. An example of this is, changing of the shutter speed, which can affect the brightness of the image but also can change whether the image is a blurred motion or focuses. It is important to understand the different settings on the camera, to be able to make your photos different.</p>
<p>Photography - In order to get photos that aren't just average, you have to be clear on all the settings and their effect on the photo. If not you will just have poor quality images, so this is crucial to my final submission, it also helps to show I can use a camera in a variety of ways.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Wednesday 13<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>For this week&rsquo;s Digital Wednesday, we looked at the work of Dieter Rams, and his 10 principles of Good Design. This was a useful source to read closely about as it gives you goals and guidelines to a website. His third principle, &lsquo;Good design is aesthetic&rsquo;, is key when studying media, as it has to be appealing to the eye to be successful, which also links with how our photography work needs to be top quality.</p>

<p>I will implement this advice, as well as his other principles into my portfolio, by not only making the website visually pleasing, so much more people interact and use it but also focus on making my photos in photography perfect, so they are aesthetic as they can be; this will also apply with my video. I feel it is important that the website I produce also goes pleasingly alongside my photographs in order for them to compliment one another.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Thursday 14<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>

<p>I was unwell this day, so I missed the lesson. I caught up with a friend, and they looked at how to do the headlines: photography, video, audio, digital log. Which makes the links on the website clear. This is useful to know as the website has to have at least 5 working links before submitting it.</p>


<br>
<p><strong>Friday 15<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>I was unwell again this day, however my teacher went over everything I had missed so I wasn&rsquo;t behind. The class also had a TTC session, so I didn&rsquo;t miss much assignment work.</p>
<p>This was helpful because I now wasn&rsquo;t behind and had all my links up and running which is crucial, as you need successful links to meet the assessment criteria but also for the website to make sense.</p>
