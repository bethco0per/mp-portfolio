        <p><p><strong>Monday 25<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>

<p>Web Design &ndash; We started the week by looking closer at colours, and what colours work best on websites and what goes together. We also learnt how different colours mean different things.</p>
<p>Audio &ndash; This week we had an introduction and editing lesson. We went over the importance of location when recording, for example what conditions are best to record in.</p>

<p>Web Design &ndash; This is useful when looking at my own portfolio website, as I can look at what colours complement each other nicely.</p>
<p>Audio &ndash; This is useful when recording for our own audio because it is important to understand how to get the best possible quality of sound. Knowing how to edit the audio on Adobe is also very significant
  in order to make sure the interview recording is only two minutes long.</p>


  <p><strong>Tuesday 26th November</strong></p>

<p>Web Design &ndash; Today we looked at accessibility and inclusiveness, which is a design methodology that enables and draws on the full range of human diversity. In short, we learnt that a good website should included everyone, so you should consider every type of person and how easily accessible it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Video &ndash; In todays lesson we looked at interview techniques, such as how to structure the interview and what not to do. It is important to do research on the interviewee before hand to be able to do who, what, when and why throughout the interview. It is also useful to introduce the person you&rsquo;re interviewing at the beginning to give the audience context.</p>

It is also useful to introduce the person you&rsquo;re interviewing at the beginning to give the audience context.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Web Design- Understanding the importance of accessibility and inclusiveness is important towards our final portfolio, because I want it to be accessed by everyone who wants to look at my work. Everyone should be able to find it easy to use, so it was good in todays lesson to remember that not everyone is the same and the design must fit to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Video &ndash; As we have to video an interview for our final assignment it is beneficial to understand how to structure an interview. This is especially important because our interviews can be no longer than two minutes, so we need to know how to get the content we want in a short time which is done through the structure and interview skills.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Wednesday 27th November</strong></p>
<p>We had to do a Kahoot quiz about colour theory.</p>
<p>This is helpful as colour theory is what makes your website visually pleasing.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday 28<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>Web Design &amp; Audio &ndash; Today we had group meetings and audio assignment workshops. This is where we were left to organise and prepare within our groups. We decided on who we were going to interview and did research into them in more depth.</p>
<p>Web Design &amp; Audio &ndash; This is beneficial to our final work as we needed to work collaboratively to stay on top of our work and to all be in the same place of progress. We are interviewing my cousin, Luke (founder of Romeo Visuals) who works in media as a photographer and videographer. Therefore, doing research altogether was crucial so the rest of my group had an understanding of what he does, so that the interview ran smoothly.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Friday 29<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>

<p>Web Design &amp; Audio &ndash; We continued to work on our websites individually. I began to add more code snippets and add more depth to my website, making it different to the protype. Later in the day, we went back into our groups and put together our audio interview questions.</p>
<p>Interview with Luke Romeo (Romeo Visuals)<br /> His journey to becoming a creative director/videographer</p>
<p>Introduction - Hello, today we have an exclusive interview with Luke Romeo the founder of Romeo Visuals. He specialises in producing professional video and digital content for businesses and brands around the world.</p>

<ol>
<li>Was there any particular event that inspired you to take the route down media?</li>
<li>What equipment and software do you use to film and edit your videos and how does the equipment affect the quality of videos?</li>
<li>Whats your favourite project you have filmed?</li>
<li>Can you give one piece of advice to anyone trying to progress in videography?</li>
<li>As you have travelled to many different countries, which have you found to be the country that has had the biggest input to your career, and why?</li>
<li>Are there any difficulties you've encountered in the past and how did you overcome them?</li>
<li>Moving forwards, in your career of videography do you have any exciting plans in the upcoming future?</li>
<li>Conclusion - Thank you Luke for freeing some time out of your schedule to give us an insight into your work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Web Design &ndash; This is helpful towards my portfolio because it helps show I can change parts of the code via atom successfully. It was also useful working individually because our teacher was able to help us on specific issues.</p>
<p>Audio &ndash; It was good to get our questions/script fully prepared, as when it comes to the interview we have a full plan and structure on what we are doing.</p>
