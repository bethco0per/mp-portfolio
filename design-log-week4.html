<p>Web Design- Today we looked at infographics, and as it states in the class presentation, this is when we use visual elements to present information to our audience. Rachel Gillett for the fast company found research to suggest that visuals are processed 60,000 times faster than text, which is why tweets with images are 94% more likely to be retweeted than tweets without. As well as this, we were shown how to make our own infographics, through sites such as Canva, Venngage and Adobe Spark.</p>
<p>Audio - Recorded our final audio interview with Luke Romeo about his career in media of videography and creative design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Video &ndash; We also began looking at video, we started by being shown how to use and set up the equipment and shot sizes, to which we then got into groups of three and put it to practice the shots while filming clips of a moving football. We then edited this into a sequence using Adobe.</p>

<br>
<p>Web Design &ndash; knowing how to create infographics is a good thing to learn how to do successfully and understanding the benefits of them allows me to include a couple within my own website. Doing this can make my website more inviting and also be more accessible to a wider audience, as people who find it harder processing text can digest an understanding from my infographics instead.</p>
<p>Audio &ndash; Now our audio is recorded I am able to edit it using Adobe Audition, however this could be challenging as the interview was 9 minutes packed with quality content, that I must now cut down to two minutes, to meet the guidelines of the assessment.</p>
<p>Video &ndash; Obviously it is highly important to understand the equipment to be able to successfully record our interview.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Tuesday 3<sup>rd</sup> December</strong></p>
<p></p>

<p>Web Design &ndash; We were looking at the UX of our website today, which is crucial to web design as this is the process helps to create a website that really means something to the user. It is important when developing your website to make sure you step into the target audience&rsquo;s shoes and view it from their perspective. Is your website a good experience?</p>
<p>Video - We focused on production skills, and single camera interview techniques. These include things such as, the 180 degree rule, and the rule of thirds. We then recorded a practice interview so we were aware of how to do this.</p>
<br>
<p>Web Design &ndash; This was particular useful to learn and important to bare in mind when designing my own website. It is very easy to get caught up in it, however we must step back and look at the portfolio in different perspectives at time to time.</p>
<p>Video &ndash; Understanding the 180 degree rule is crucial to our video interview, as we only have one camera to film it but two different angles to film: the interviewee and the interviewer.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Wednesday 4<sup>th</sup> December</strong></p>
<p>Web Design – We had to record a 30 second audio clip discussing our design log, to practice embedding into our website when were back in uni.</p>
<p>Both Digital Wednesday activities were useful towards my final portfolio, because they are both good practice towards my final submission.</p>
<p>Video – Using the footage we filmed with the balls, we used Adobe Premiere to edit a rough cut sequence and the news interviews. </p>

<p>Web Design – How to embed multimedia content on the web through platforms such as Soundcloud, Vimeo and YouTube. To do this you must use &lt;iframe&gt; which allows you to then embed other web documents into the current documents. Using third- party in web is beneficial as it is still effective but saves storage space, however they can be unpredictable and change without you knowing as you’re not in control of that website, just your own.</p>
        <p>Video – Today, we looked at video editing techniques, such as cut aways, we also looked at the rule of third in more depth, this is crucial when recording an interview with one camera as the shots are filmed at different perspectives but the eye line must match so it doesn’t look like the questions have been recorded separately to the responses. We also went over noddies and GVs, which are useful when editing.</p>

<p><strong>Friday 6th December </strong></p>
<p>Web Design – Knowing how to do this is majorly important because we have to embed a map, audio and a video. Fully understanding how to use the coding to incorporate other websites into my own, makes adding to my portfolio much easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Video – With using only one camera, the different shots and different clips are crucial to knowing how to conduct our interview well, as when making our video we must consider that the eye line matches up, and that the angles are right so you can tell that the two people are engaged in a conversation together.</p>

Web Design & Video – In the four hours today, we worked individually to crack on with our websites and get everything ready, so that it is ready to upload all our other content, such as photos and audio. We also worked in our groups to plan through exactly what we were going to do for our video interview and what location we would film it in.
