          <p><strong>Monday 9<sup>th</sup> December</strong></p>
<p>Web Design – We briefly looked at accessibility again, which means to consider accessible colours, minimal font use, alt text to describe an image, avoiding auto play on audio and video, and updated title tags on every page. We also had a demonstration on how to change iconography.</p>
<p>Video – &nbsp;Today we just finalised everything for the video interview with an aspiring singer. By this, we just went over the questions and also made sure we had a quick introduction.</p>
<p>Web Design – Accessibility is important to apply this in our own website, as this is part of the guideline to the final work and knowing how to apply this well, allows you to do it more efficiently.</p>
<p>Video – Its very important to get the questions perfect, as two minutes is a very short amount of time, therefore to get the most out of the interview you must ask questions that you defiantly want the answer to. There is no time for wish wash questions.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday 10<sup>th</sup> December</strong></p>
<p>Video- We recorded our video interview with Clarice on the sofa in the media lab. This went well, as we used the 180 degree rule to first film her responses and then we separately filmed Beth, asking the questions. We also got round to filming noddies and hand gestures, to help us when it comes to doing the final edit.</p>
<p>We also had a guest speaker, Kevin Palmer, a sports journalist, who gave us an insight to his career in journalism.</p>
  <p>Video – Obviously, this is essential to our final portfolio as we have to embed the 2 minute video interview to show our technical skills.</p>
  <p>Guest Speaker – having a professional journalist in was useful to our assignment as he explained the importance of knowing what questions you want to ask, and what you want to gain from the interview.</p>

  <p><strong>W</strong><strong>ednesday 11th December</strong></p>
  <p>Worked on design log, filling out and updating.</p>

  <p><strong>Thursday 12<sup>th</sup> December</strong></p>
  <p>We worked Independently again, and in this time I &nbsp;embedded my edited audio and photos into my website, as well as this &nbsp;I also wrote any subtitles and captions that were needed to finish off my photography page. As well as this I finalised my audio page with context on who we interviewed and example of his own work.</p>
  <p>This is important to my final submission, as it getting all part of my work for the past 5 weeks put onto my final website. </p>
  <p>

  </p>

  <p><strong>Friday 13<sup>th</sup> December</strong></p>
<p>Today I finished off finalising my website. Which meant I inserted my video onto the page and also worked on my alt text and infographics. Obviously today is deadline day, so I will also shortly be submitting.</p>
