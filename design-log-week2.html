<h2>Week 2</h2>


        <p><p><strong>Monday 18<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
    <p>Web Design - We focused on code snippets, which in web design typically includes HTML. It is essential to understand code snippets while doing this, as this is where the changes to the website come from.</p>
<p>Photography - We looked at things such as the Exposure Triangle: Shutter speed, ISO and Aperture in more detail, as well as this we looked at white balance. After this we were then allocated our groups in which we would do our photos, audio, and videos with, and then chose the topic we want to photograph; my group decided to do street art.</p>
<p>Web Design &ndash; This helps towards my final submission because I can understand how to make my website more original, as I can make changes so it appears exactly how I want them to look.</p>

<p>Photography &ndash; This is essential when looking at photography because we need to understand how to get the best possible shots from the camera. Having knowledge of the camera will also help me hugely when I look at making our group video.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Tuesday 19<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Web Design - I had all my links on my website working at this point, therefore I tried to change colours and fonts on my Web Page, using google fonts and used Atoms to change the code, and GitHub to submit the changes I had made.</p>
<p>Photography - In lesson we looked at downloading adobe photoshop onto the university computers. We also looked at how to do basic editing, through contrast and exposure.</p>

<br>

<p>Web Design &ndash; This helps with my final website as I can now make my website much more original and unique to me. Being able to change the colours means that it can look the way I want it to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Photography &ndash; It is crucial to know how to do edit images, as this can help improve the final look of an image, as it can change the brightness and just make the appeal generally more aesthetic.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Wednesday 20th November</strong></p>
<p>For Digital Wednesday, we looked at defining key words for coding in Web Design, by reading a text.</p>

<p>Coding is the core of Web Design, therefore being clear on what all the codes mean, makes it much easier to understand the process of web design and I will be able to make changes much quicker.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Thursday 21<sup>st</sup> November</strong></p>

<p>Web Design - We were helped with any problems we had overcome, through this I learnt how to change my background of my Website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Photography - In our groups we went into the centre of Manchester to have a practice at taking photos of street art. We took our camera to the Northern Quarter, as there is lots of street art there and took a few images each.</p>
<br>
<p>Web Design &ndash; My teacher went through problems I has with me, which was missing certain symbols in the code. This was extremely helpful, as I now understand how vital it is to not miss anything out of the code and always double check on atom because one small mistake can make&nbsp; a huge difference to the overall design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Photograph &ndash; This helped to get a real feel for the camera equipment, it was also good to work within our allocated group, as we are working together until the final portfolio submission.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Friday 22<sup>nd</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>Today we worked on our design log and made any more changes to our Website, before submission later on today. My teacher also helped me change the images to a sample image on my photography page.</p>
<p>This was useful because it means that I am able to make significant &nbsp;changes to website by changing images and colours.</p>
